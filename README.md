Custom Context Menu with Icons
A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that creates a custom right-click context menu with six options, including copy, cut, paste, delete, open in new tab, and more info.
 The menu is enhanced with icons from Font Awesome for a modern look and better user experience.
 The menu dynamically appears at the mouse click position and can be closed by clicking outside or pressing the Escape key.
